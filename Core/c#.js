Characteristics of C# var keyword

 var keyword initializes variables with var support.
 
  The data type of a var variable will be determined when assigning values to variables. 
  
  The following program will automatically cast the variable. And of course, after assigning the variable value, the variable has a defined data type and cannot be replaced. I

Class and struct members, including nested classes and structs, have private access by default

interfaces default to internal access

internal is the default if no access modifier is specified.

==================================================================================================================
In c#, the internal modifier is used to specify that access is limited to the current assembly. 

The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly but not from another assembly. 

Following is the example of defining the members with an internal modifier in the c# programming language.

Yes, an Abstract class always has a constructor.

 If you do not define your own constructor, the compiler will give a default constructor to the Abstract class

What is Enum in C#?
 
C# enum is a value type with a set of related named constants often referred as an enumerator list. The C# enum keyword is used to declare an enumeration. It is a primitive data type, which is user-defined

Enums are enumerated data type in C#.

Enums are not for end-users, they are meant for developers.

Enums are strongly typed constants. They are strongly typed, i.e., an enum of one type may not be implicitly assigned to an enum of another type even though the underlying value of their members are the same.

Enumerations (enums) make your code more readable and understandable.

enum values are fixed. enum can be displayed as a string and processed as an integer.

The default type is int, and the approved types are byte, sbyte, short, ushort, uint, long, and ulong.

Every enum type automatically derives from System.Enum and thus we can use System.Enum methods on enums.
Enums are value types and are created on the stack and not on the heap
